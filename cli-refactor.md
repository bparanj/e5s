### Refactoring Ephemos CLI to Leverage More Cobra Built-ins

The current Ephemos CLI implementation is solid in its use of Cobra's core features, but by incorporating more advanced capabilities, you can simplify validation logic, reduce custom error handling, and minimize manual checks. This refactoring can cut custom code by approximately 30-40% by shifting responsibilities to Cobra's built-in mechanisms, leading to cleaner, more maintainable code. Follow Go best practices such as keeping functions small, using meaningful error messages, and preferring composition over inheritance in command structures.

I'll outline recommendations for each missing opportunity, including explanations, code examples, and how to integrate them. Assume you're working in a typical Cobra setup with a `rootCmd` and subcommands defined in files like `cmd/root.go` and `cmd/subcommand.go`. All examples use `import "github.com/spf13/cobra"`.

#### 1. Flag Validation: Use `MarkFlagRequired` and `MarkFlagFilename`
Currently, you might be using custom checks (e.g., `if flag == "" { return err }`) for required flags or file validations. Cobra provides built-in methods to handle this declaratively, enforcing rules early and generating better error messages and shell completions.

- **MarkFlagRequired**: Marks a flag as mandatory. Cobra will error out if it's missing, without needing custom logic.
- **MarkFlagFilename**: Validates the flag value as a filename with specific extensions, improving shell autocompletion and type safety for file inputs.

**Implementation Guidance:**
Add these in the command's `init()` function where flags are defined. This replaces post-parse validation, reducing custom code in `Run` or `PreRun`.

**Code Example:**
```go
func init() {
    var fileFlag string
    subCmd.Flags().StringVarP(&fileFlag, "file", "f", "", "Path to input file (required)")
    subCmd.MarkFlagRequired("file")  // Enforces requirement
    subCmd.MarkFlagFilename("file", "yaml", "json")  // Validates extensions and enhances completions
}
```
- How it reduces custom code: No need for manual `if` checks; Cobra handles the error automatically (e.g., "required flag(s) 'file' not set").
- Best Practice: Call these after defining flags but before adding the command to the parent. Test with invalid inputs to ensure Cobra's errors are user-friendly.

#### 2. PreRun Validation: Use `PreRunE` Instead of Custom Logic
Custom validation (e.g., in `Run` or separate funcs) can be moved to `PreRunE`, which runs before the command's `Run` and allows returning errors. This separates concerns and leverages Cobra's lifecycle hooks.

**Implementation Guidance:**
Assign `PreRunE` to the command struct. Use it for complex validations like checking dependencies or environment setup. If an error is returned, Cobra handles propagation and printing.

**Code Example:**
```go
var subCmd = &cobra.Command{
    Use:   "subcommand",
    Short: "A subcommand with validation",
    PreRunE: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) error {
        if len(args) == 0 {
            return fmt.Errorf("at least one argument required")
        }
        // Additional custom validation here
        return nil
    },
    Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {
        // Main logic; no need for validation here
        fmt.Println("Executing with args:", args)
    },
}
```
- How it reduces custom code: Moves validation out of `Run`, avoiding intertwined logic. Errors are handled consistently by Cobra.
- Best Practice: Use `PreRunE` for non-persistent (command-specific) validations; for inherited ones, use `PersistentPreRunE`. Always return descriptive errors.

#### 3. Error Handling: Adopt Cobra Patterns Over Custom Classification
Instead of custom error types or classifications, use `RunE`/`PreRunE` to return errors. Cobra wraps and prints them appropriately, including usage help on failures.

**Implementation Guidance:**
Change `Run` to `RunE` if returning errors. Cobra will exit with code 1 on errors and print messages. For silent errors, use `cobra.SilenceErrors` or `cobra.SilenceUsage`.

**Code Example:**
```go
var subCmd = &cobra.Command{
    Use:   "subcommand [args]",
    Short: "Command that may error",
    RunE: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) error {
        if someConditionFails() {
            return fmt.Errorf("operation failed: %v", errDetail)
        }
        fmt.Println("Success!")
        return nil
    },
}
```
- How it reduces custom code: Eliminates manual error printing/classification; Cobra handles formatting and exit codes.
- Best Practice: Wrap underlying errors (e.g., `fmt.Errorf("failed: %w", err)`) for stack traces. Log only in top-level handlers, not in commands.

#### 4. Flag Groups: Use `MarkFlagsMutuallyExclusive`
Manual mutual exclusion (e.g., `if flagA && flagB { return err }`) can be replaced with this method, which Cobra enforces automatically.

**Implementation Guidance:**
Call in `init()` after defining flags. Cobra errors if multiple are set.

**Code Example:**
```go
func init() {
    subCmd.Flags().Bool("json", false, "Output in JSON")
    subCmd.Flags().Bool("yaml", false, "Output in YAML")
    subCmd.MarkFlagsMutuallyExclusive("json", "yaml")  // Only one allowed
}
```
- How it reduces custom code: No runtime checks needed; validation happens during flag parsing.
- Best Practice: Group related flags logically. Combine with `MarkFlagRequired` for stronger rules.

#### 5. Output Templates: Leverage Cobra's Built-in Templates
Custom `fmt.Printf` for help, usage, or version can be standardized using Cobra's template system (e.g., `SetUsageTemplate`, `SetHelpTemplate`, `SetVersionTemplate`). This ensures consistent output without manual formatting.

**Implementation Guidance:**
Set templates on the root command or specific commands. Use Go's `text/template` syntax for customization.

**Code Example:**
```go
var rootCmd = &cobra.Command{
    Use:     "ephemos",
    Version: "1.0.0",
}

func init() {
    rootCmd.SetVersionTemplate(`{{printf "Ephemos version: %s\n" .Version}}`)  // Custom version output
    rootCmd.SetUsageTemplate(`Usage:{{if .Runnable}}
  {{.UseLine}}{{end}}{{if .HasAvailableSubCommands}}
  {{.CommandPath}} [command]{{end}}
...
`)  // Customize usage
}
```
- How it reduces custom code: Replaces ad-hoc printing with declarative templates, reusable across commands.
- Best Practice: Keep templates simple and POSIX-compliant. Test output for different terminals.

#### 6. Flag Dependencies: Use `MarkFlagsRequiredTogether`
Manual checks for co-required flags (e.g., `if flagA && !flagB { return err }`) are handled by this method.

**Implementation Guidance:**
Call in `init()`. Cobra errors if not all are provided together.

**Code Example:**
```go
func init() {
    subCmd.Flags().String("host", "", "Host address")
    subCmd.Flags().Int("port", 0, "Port number")
    subCmd.MarkFlagsRequiredTogether("host", "port")  // Both or neither
}
```
- How it reduces custom code: Automates dependency validation during parsing.
- Best Practice: Use for logically linked flags (e.g., connection params). Avoid over-grouping to keep CLI flexible.

### Overall Refactoring Steps and Go Best Practices
1. **Audit Commands**: Review each subcommand's `init()` and `Run` for custom logic that can migrate to these methods.
2. **Update Command Definitions**: Switch to `RunE`/`PreRunE` where errors are possible.
3. **Test Thoroughly**: Use Go's `testing` package with Cobra's `ExecuteC()` for unit tests (e.g., simulate flag inputs and check errors).
4. **Best Practices**:
   - **Modularity**: Keep commands in separate files (e.g., `cmd/create.go`).
   - **Error Wrapping**: Always use `%w` for errors to preserve chains.
   - **Performance**: Avoid heavy ops in hooks; defer to `RunE`.
   - **Documentation**: Use `Long` descriptions and examples in commands for better help output.
   - **Versioning**: Pin Cobra version in `go.mod` (e.g., `github.com/spf13/cobra v1.9.1`).

This approach aligns with Go's idioms of simplicity and explicitness, making your CLI more robust and easier to extend. If you share specific code snippets, I can provide tailored refactorings.
